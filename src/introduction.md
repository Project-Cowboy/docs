# Introduction

"Cowboy" is an early-stage protocol that enables proving facts about arbitrary web data, in a privacy-preserving manner.

## Why
This allows blockchain applications, and indeed, regular applications to prove statements about data which were not possible previously.

A few examples of this:

- a Defi loan contract allows users to get bitcoin loans based on a zkTLS applications which designates an earnings tier for them based on their bank account balance and income.
- A blockchain application gets a strong identity primitive through a zkTLS application which retrieves a unique state id from a website, and hashes it.
- A DAO verifies that a user has a particular social media attribute, such as their follower count, and assigns them a score tag and identity credential.
