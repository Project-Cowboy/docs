# Example Integrations

Cowboy enables developers to build privacy-preserving proofs about web data using custom integrations. This section gives a high-level overview of how these integrations are structured, how they work, and what they enable.

## 🎯 Purpose of Integrations

Integrations allow developers to:

- **Prove specific statements** about web data (e.g., “My age according to a government website is over 21.”)
- **Embed custom logic** that runs inside zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Emit structured public outputs** for use in identity systems, scoring mechanisms, credentials, or composable applications.

This is the *utility layer* of Cowboy, where developers define what they want to verify about web data and how it can be reused across the ecosystem.

## 🏗️ Integration Structure

Each integration includes the following key components:

- **A web target** — An endpoint or page on the internet (e.g., `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/jigglypuff`) whose request/response will be proven.
- **An application-specific program** — A zk-STARK circuit written in Rust that verifies the TLSNotary proof (core proof) and checks custom conditions about the fetched data (e.g., checking follower count, extracting specific fields).
- **Public outputs** — Optional values emitted by the program after verification, used on-chain or by other integration proofs.

These programs are tested using the Cowboy prover container and submitted to the devnet for deployment and interaction.

## 🧪 Example Integration Overview

The example integrations demonstrate both what’s possible and how to use the provided dev tools for building, testing, and uploading integrations. Each includes:

1. **TLSNotary Proof Input**  
   Each integration expects a TLSNotary proof aligned to a specific URL — for example, the TikTok integration requires a proof of a request to `www.tiktok.com/aweme/v2/data/insight/`. This proof is generated by the browser extension and passed to the prover.

   > ✅ Both example integrations come with a working sample proof so you can start developing immediately. You can also generate your own proof using the extension and prover.

2. **Utilities**  
   - `run`: Prove your integration locally against a given input. This is useful during development.
   - `upload`: Deploy your integration to the chain so that others can use it and verify proofs onchain.
