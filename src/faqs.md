Q: What are 'integrations' in Cowboy?
A: Custom integrations consist of Rust programs written by developers which receive a "core" proof that authenticates the web data, and then enacts its own custom logic against that web data. This execution is proven as a zk-STARK. This program is uploaded onchain. Verifications of this proof can output public outputs of the proof that the developer wrote.
 
Q: What are 'proofs' in Cowboy?
A: Supported proofs in Cowboy are zk-STARK proofs, generated by a RISC Zero prover. Proofs can be split into three categories:
- TLS Notary proofs
- "Core" Proofs
- Application-specific proofs
 
TLS Notary proofs are generated by your browser and the selected notary, following the TLS Notary protocol. "Core" proofs are proofs that ensure the integrity of the TLS Notary proof, and are a requirement for any custom integration. Application-specific proofs are generated by custom integrations written by developers.
